# Wordle Helper
Program that aids you in playing Wordle on hard mode. Uses your inputs (green, yellow and grey letters) to display all the valid (dictionary) words you can use for your next guess. For the first two input lines, use hyphens ("-") for letters that don't correspond to green or yellow letters (ie. "s-i-e" if the word guessed was "shine").

Serves as an exercise in C++ loops, string manipulation and I/O.
